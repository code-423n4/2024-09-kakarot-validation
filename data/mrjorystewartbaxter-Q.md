## **Summary**  

The `pow()` function in the `Exponentiation` from `math.cairo` (https://github.com/kkrt-labs/kakarot-ssj/blob/d4a7873d6f071813165ca7c7adb2f029287d14ca/crates/utils/src/math.cairo) trait does not correctly validate the base value, leading to potential panics in an edge case involving the conversion of negative signed integers to unsigned types. This flaw can trigger unintended behavior, particularly when using type conversions.

## **Vulnerability Details**  

The `pow()` function expects an **unsigned integer** as the base, and the current test cases only account for unsigned inputs. Although the function doesn't directly accept signed integers, an edge case arises when a negative signed integer is **converted to an unsigned integer**. This scenario isn't handled in the tests, which could result in unexpected behavior.

### **Explanation:**

When converting a **signed integer** to an **unsigned type** in Cairo, the outcome depends on whether the code is compiled in **debug mode** or **release mode**.

```rust
use core::convert::TryInto;

fn main() {
    let negative_signed: i32 = -50;

    // Panics in debug mode, wraps in release mode
    let unsigned_result: u32 = negative_signed.try_into().unwrap();
}
```

- **Debug mode**: The conversion will panic because a negative value cannot be represented in an unsigned type.  
- **Release mode**: The conversion will wrap around, producing an incorrect value (not recommended behavior).  

---

### **Proof of Concept:**

Consider this test case in `test_pow()`:

```rust
fn test_pow() {
    let positive_signed: i32 = -50; // Negative value that is converted to unsigned
    let unsigned_from_positive: u32 = positive_signed.try_into().unwrap();
    // Calling the pow function normally, but it will panic
    assert(unsigned_from_positive.pow(0) == 1, "n^0 should be 1");
}
```

Although the code compiles, it will **panic** during execution:

```
[FAIL] utils::math::tests::test_pow

Failure data:
    0x4f7074696f6e3a3a756e77726170206661696c65642e ('Option::unwrap failed.')
```

This demonstrates that even though the function expects an unsigned integer, the use of a **converted signed integer** can cause the function to fail.

---

## **Recommendation**  

The `pow()` function assumes the base is an unsigned integer, but improper handling of converted signed integers introduces a vulnerability. Cairo does not automatically prevent or handle such conversions. Developers should implement appropriate input validation to ensure the **base value is non-negative** or always passed as an **absolute value** to avoid these issues.
