Issues 1:
Missing type declaration for arr_len:
"func pad_end{range_check_ptr}(arr_len, arr: felt*, size: felt)"
The type of arr_len is not explicitly declared, which can cause compilation errors. It should be felt.

Issues 2:
Redundant Passing of size:
You're passing size twice into the Gas.max_memory_expansion_cost() function. The second argument should likely be src, dst, size â€” correct the parameters to prevent potential logic errors in gas calculation.
 // GAS
        let memory_expansion = Gas.max_memory_expansion_cost(
            memory.words_len, src, size, dst, size
        );

Issues3:

The code assigns the same value to both storage and storage_start, transient_storage and transient_storage_start, and valid_jumpdests and valid_jumpdests_start in the constructor.
https://github.com/kkrt-labs/kakarot/blob/697100af34444b3931c18596cec56c454caf28ed/src/kakarot/account.cairo#L66C12-L67C55
This might be redundant and could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if the values are intended to be different.
If the intention is to use these values as starting points for storage, transient storage, and valid jumpdests, it might be more appropriate to use separate variables for the starting points and the actual storage, transient storage, and valid jumpdest data.

Issue 4:
"func dict_to_array{dict_ptr: DictAccess*}(arr: felt*, len)"

Issue: This function takes a pointer to an array (arr) and a length (len), but the type of len is not specified. Typically, felt should be the type for integers.
