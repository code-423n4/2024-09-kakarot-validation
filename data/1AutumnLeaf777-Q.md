In the `fetch_or_create` function: https://github.com/kkrt-labs/kakarot/blob/7411a5520e8a00be6f5243a50c160e66ad285563/src/kakarot/account.cairo#L111-L137
the account's codehash is always computed as `EMPTY_CODE_HASH` even though it should be 0 if the account has no code,balance,or nonce. Note that the `extcodehash` opcode is implemented correctly and accounts for these cases. As a result accessing an account's codehash from within Kakarot behaves properly as far as I can tell.
