Explanation:
The library does not emit events for critical state changes (e.g., when a successful call, delegatecall, or staticcall is executed). Events are vital for on-chain transparency and off-chain monitoring.
Impact:
Low to Moderate Impact: Lack of events makes it hard for external observers (e.g., dApps, monitoring systems) to track important contract interactions. This can lead to decreased transparency or delayed response times in case of an issue.
Mitigation:
Emit events for important state-changing or external call interactions. This makes it easier to audit the contract's behavior and catch any potential issues early.
Example event addition:
event CairoCallExecuted(address indexed target, uint256 functionSelector, bytes result);

function callCairo(uint256 contractAddress, uint256 functionSelector, uint256[] memory data)
    internal
    returns (bytes memory)
{
    bytes memory result = _callCairo(contractAddress, functionSelector, data);
    emit CairoCallExecuted(contractAddress, functionSelector, result);
    return result;
}
